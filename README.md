# Revit Multi-File Upgrader
A simple utility for performing batch conversions on Revit projects/families within the Revit!  I made this as an alternative to the batch converter that comes with Revit with the inclusion of a GUI that simplifies the process.

This add-in is made in .NET.  At the moment, it only supports 2014 MEP, I will be quickly expanding this to all versions of Revit.
